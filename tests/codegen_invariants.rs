//! Codegen invariants — regression guards for hand-written safety gates that
//! `metaphor schema generate` does NOT emit and would otherwise strip on regen.
//!
//! This file is `user_owned` (metaphor.codegen.yaml), so it survives regen too.
//! If a test here fails, regen (or a manual edit) removed a safety gate — re-apply
//! it on the named source file and confirm that file is listed as `user_owned`.

/// The unvalidated generic-CRUD mounts must stay gated behind
/// `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "unguarded"))]` so they are unreachable unless a
/// consumer explicitly opts in. For promo this is not just master-data hygiene:
/// the generic surface includes full CRUD over the loyalty point ledger, and an
/// unguarded mount would let a client mint `earned` rows directly — exactly what
/// the server-authoritative points posture forbids.
///
/// `metaphor schema generate` does not emit these attributes — without this guard,
/// regen would silently re-expose the unvalidated CRUD surface by default.
